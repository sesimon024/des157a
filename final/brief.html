            <p>I am planning to update my Every Picture project and want to focus on improving the UI/UX and the visual design. I plan to primarily focus on the visual design aspect but focus on key concepts of ui/ux such as the usability and the information architecture</p>

            <h2>Give a description of your project and how you will improbe on the sections mentioned above</h2>
            <p>I plan to improve the mobile experience by having the animations load without the user having to select each image, and for there to be an image that is ‘sticky’ to the bottom of the screen so that the user can just click it and it smoothly scrolls down to the next image an repeats that same animation (these areas focus on usability). For both mobile and desktop, I plan to add a repeating background to make it feel more finished (this is for visual design). I also plan to transition the background based on the image you are on and have an animation for the image to get bigger as you hover over it and display the animation (this would focus on visual design and interactions). I am considering incorporating a scroll to go horizontally idea, but have to figure out the logistics for that (this would be primarily for visual design).</p>

            <h2>How will you get Expert Feedback?</h2>
            <p>To get expert feedback, for my visual design, I will talk with the professor and the design tutor. To get expert feedback for my UI/UX design I will talk with the professor and another professor that taught my UI/UX class or my cousin who works in UI/UX.</p>
