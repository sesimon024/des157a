            <p>I am trying to make the website feel more complete and capture more of the audience's attention. I chose to input a section where the user hovers over the timeline to unveil the image. I feel like this makes the website feel like more of a journey and more interactive. I also made the backgorund change so that the user is able to visualize the differences between the images and capture the user's gaze. In the final one, I might make it so that there is less opacity on the background so that the images are still more of a focus.</p>
