            <h4>My Findings and Thoughts</h4>

            <div class="flexToColumns">
                
                <p class="column1Journal">I chose to review the article, "Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes" by the Nielsen Norman Group. I found this article to be very intruiging. One of the principles that I hadn't thought of before is if the overlay has a scrolling option within it and the difficutlties this would present in usability for users. This is something that I will definetly make sure to avoid in my designs. One thing that I had a question about was the use of overlays in mobile devices: for example, if there are parameters or guidelines as to when these should or shouldn't be used.</p>
                
                <p class="column2Journal">They they mentioned limiting the use of anchors in an overlay and I definetly agree with this guideline becuase I think it would make it incredibly hard for the user to revisit these links at a future time if, say, the overlay was triggered by the loading of the page. I have had this experience multiple times in the past, especially in onboarding experiences, where I don't need the information in that particular moment, but chances of me finding it again are like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>

            <h4>My Findings and Thoughts</h4>
            
            <div class="flexToColumns">
                
                <p class="column1Journal">I think that for the most part I agree with the tips and guidelines included in the article, "Best Practices for From Design." I think that some of the key guidelines that I would implement in my own forms are: minimizing dropdowns, including labels vs putting labels as placeholder text, and including a progress section for longer forms. I think that this was a very informitive article that was able to give me some insight as to what styling I should keep in mind while creating forms in the future. This will be very useful for our MadLibs assignment, especially when it comes to lables and placeholder text.</p>
                
                <p class="column2Journal">Some of the guidelines that seem a bit controversial to me is the placing of placeholder text under the box itself. While I see that it can be frustrating to have a the text dissapear when typing in the answer, I think for the majority of instances, after the user has been primed to insert a specific text, that text is no longer needed. It might become a bit of a cognitive overload if there is a lot of fields required and there is an example below each input field. I would probably only think to place an example text underneath the input field in an instance where the text is longer or more context than a couple of words is needed. But I'm definetly open to learning more about why this might not be a good idea!</p>

            <h4>An Example of a Good Form</h4>
            <div>
                <p class="adjustForColumn">One form that I liked, was <a href="https://pets.byspotify.com/">Spotify for Pets</a> because of it's progrss bar, clear highlighting of your selections, and clear labels. Some more of the best practices here are the short amount of steps (4), including clear labels that don't dissapear, and using graphics instead of a drop-down selector.</p>
