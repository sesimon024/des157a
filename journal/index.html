                <div>
                    <h4>Why and how is this image interesting? Tell us something we would not know by looking at the image alone.</h4>
                    <p>I think this image is interesting because there is motion, specifically of the bees. I also think the reflection of the water adds to the character, especially since I generally see flowers growing more in nature out in the soil, rather than in water.</p>

                    <h4>How does this image relate to the topic of your archive or collection?</h4>
                    <p>This relates to the topic of my archive/collection because it is an image that I took while visiting Thailand and it takes me back to the time that I spent there.</p>
                    
                    <h4>How does your collection or archive say something (i.e. tell a story) about you?</h4>
                    <p>My collection does tell a story about me and about what I like to do and what I find interesting while traveling</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>What is this image about?</h4>
                    <p>This image shows a kitten looking up at its owner. It is adorable and laying on some blankets, blending in a little bit. This kitten is relaxed and calm, waiting for affection from the owner. The cat looks very inquisitive and patient.</p>

                    <h4>What are the most interesting aspects of this image? Describe using some of the language in the introduction to this assignment.</h4>
                    <p>The most interesting and captivating part of this image are the eyes and the way they are captured by the camera, looking straight at it.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What are the most obvious and the most mysterious aspects of this image?</h4>
                    <p>The most obvious aspects are the relaxed body posture of the cat and the most mysterious is,  "who is the cat looking at?"</p>

                    I do agree with what this article is saying about how students tend to skim their readings and try to get the fastest meaning out of their assignments. I don't think this is necessarily our fault, it's kind of how we were brought up, in a fast-paced world, but taking a moment to really notice the details is essential, especially in design. I found it really resonating when they mentioned practicing the art of visual thinking. One example I thought was really cool was having students take a guess at what is happening in a caption-less image.

                <p class="column2Journal">
                    I think this method would be a good way of getting students engaged in the material and I know that I have found great fun in this when I did so in middle school. I think that many times I get stuck in one perspective so, as the article states, I think I should definitely be practicing in expanding my knowledge and consistently aiming to expand the differnt persepctives in which I approach my designs.

                <p class="adjustForColumn">One example of visual thinking skills being applied that I liked, was <a href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/our-history/">Scroll Through Time with Google</a> because it really allows the user to engage with what happened along google's journey and how it came to be today. Each image and small caption brings the user deeper into the story of the birth of Google and allows the user to feel more connected with the product and empathize to hope for its success!</p>

            <h4>My Findings and Thoughts</h4>

            <div class="flexToColumns">
                
                <p class="column1Journal">I chose to review the article, "Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes" by the Nielsen Norman Group. I found this article to be very intruiging. One of the principles that I hadn't thought of before is if the overlay has a scrolling option within it and the difficutlties this would present in usability for users. This is something that I will definetly make sure to avoid in my designs. One thing that I had a question about was the use of overlays in mobile devices: for example, if there are parameters or guidelines as to when these should or shouldn't be used.</p>
                
                <p class="column2Journal">They they mentioned limiting the use of anchors in an overlay and I definetly agree with this guideline becuase I think it would make it incredibly hard for the user to revisit these links at a future time if, say, the overlay was triggered by the loading of the page. I have had this experience multiple times in the past, especially in onboarding experiences, where I don't need the information in that particular moment, but chances of me finding it again are like finding a needle in a haystack.</p>

            <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
            <h3>Read about the article: <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for From Design</a></h3>

            <h4>My Findings and Thoughts</h4>
            
            <div class="flexToColumns">
                
                <p class="column1Journal">I think that for the most part I agree with the tips and guidelines included in the article, "Best Practices for From Design." I think that some of the key guidelines that I would implement in my own forms are: minimizing dropdowns, including labels vs putting labels as placeholder text, and including a progress section for longer forms. I think that this was a very informitive article that was able to give me some insight as to what styling I should keep in mind while creating forms in the future. This will be very useful for our MadLibs assignment, especially when it comes to lables and placeholder text.</p>
                
                <p class="column2Journal">Some of the guidelines that seem a bit controversial to me is the placing of placeholder text under the box itself. While I see that it can be frustrating to have a the text dissapear when typing in the answer, I think for the majority of instances, after the user has been primed to insert a specific text, that text is no longer needed. It might become a bit of a cognitive overload if there is a lot of fields required and there is an example below each input field. I would probably only think to place an example text underneath the input field in an instance where the text is longer or more context than a couple of words is needed. But I'm definetly open to learning more about why this might not be a good idea!</p>

            <h4>An Example of a Good Form</h4>
            <div>
                <p class="adjustForColumn">One form that I liked, was <a href="https://pets.byspotify.com/">Spotify for Pets</a> because of it's progrss bar, clear highlighting of your selections, and clear labels. Some more of the best practices here are the short amount of steps (4), including clear labels that don't dissapear, and using graphics instead of a drop-down selector.</p>
