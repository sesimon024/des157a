            <p>I remember my parents and I going on a trip for my 20th birthday. We were at a revered park filled with black sand and this vibrant flower stood out to me. This reminds me of the great memories that I have with my parents.</p>

            <p>I remember returning to Davis for the summer after returning from visiting home. I really enjoy walking through the arboretum, so I went through with my friend Shreya and we found these beautiful vibrant maroon and gold flowers. I remember feeling so happy to have such a good friend and enjoying our time together.</p>
